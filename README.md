**Understanding the Black-Scholes Implementation**
##

The model estimates the fair value of an option by considering factors such as the : - <br/>
S: Current stock price <br/>
X: Strike price of the option <br/>
r: Risk-free interest rate <br/>
T: Time to expiration (in years) <br/>
Ïƒ: Annualized stock volatility <br/>
